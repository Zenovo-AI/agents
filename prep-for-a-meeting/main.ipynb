      "Text: The new year is fast approaching, and short-term rental trends are already taking shape.  ‍ Preparing your short-term rental business for 2024 is vital for your continued success, so we polled our team of vacation rental experts at Beyond for their big bets and recommendations for 2024. With a combined 30+ years in the short-term rental industry, they brought forward thoughtful predictions, plus actionable advice for hosts and property managers to win in 2024. ‍ Julie Brinkman, CEO ‍ With 2024 being an election year in the U.S., I think we will see a stabilization of some of the macro jolts that both the U.S. and the world have experienced - namely with interest rates, oil prices, and exchange rates staying flat. The short-term rental (STR) industry is poised to have a fantastic year, as travelers clearly desire STRs and all they offer - and stable macroeconomic conditions give them all the confidence they need to take the trip they want.  ‍ Where will this manifest? Across the entire category and market types. If the vacation rental property manager and host are systematically staying on top of demand, they will not only see flat to higher average daily rates (ADRs) year-over-year, but also certainly, increased occupancy.  ‍ For North America, I believe destination markets will have a better year than last, especially this spring break and summer – although mid to late August might be soft again due to school schedules. Should school schedules or weather patterns change, those property managers attuned to demand will be able to proactively shift their revenue management strategies to make the most of the high travel seasons. ‍ For Europe, the Olympics should be another boon and give this region another fantastic summer from foreigners looking to experience incredible sights and experiences. While this summer may not set records like 2023, it certainly will return meaningful revenue for those property managers who are taking advantage of the increased travel demand.  ‍ While less prominent than North America and Europe, I also believe Latin America and Asia-Pacific (APAC) will continue their upswing both in supply and demand. As flight prices come down, those destinations tend to be more affordable, and the modernization of travel experiences opens up these markets to new travelers. ‍ While urban markets will continue to come under regulation pressure, you will start to see a banding together of those of us in STRs to tell the right story - about the economic benefit STRs bring to communities, vs. letting the hotel lobby control the conversation and cause STR infighting. ‍ I'm feeling bullish coming into 2024 - the past few years have propelled our industry to new heights and horizons, as demand and supply skyrocketed - and as the dust and normalcy have settled, the vacation rental hosts and property managers who have weathered this era are in an even better position to grow and flourish in 2024.  ‍ David Kelso, Co-Founder &amp; CTO ‍ For the first time in about ten years, we saw supply growth outstrip demand growth in 2023. I believe that was an anomaly and we’ll see stabilization of U.S. supply growth, without seeing a reduced growth of demand, which will lead to higher ADRs across markets. Conversely, Europe will see more of a pullback than anticipated as travel from the U.S. retreats from its 2023 post-pandemic euphoria. ‍ As a result of seeing lower ADRs for the first time (outside of COVID), owners churned from property managers at higher rates in 2023, and I expect that to normalize back to historical levels. However, their increased expectations for transparency into the performance of the properties are here to stay. That leaves less room for mistakes from property managers and drives the importance of reporting, and adding real-time data sources like search data. ‍ Airbnb will continue to dominate and will accelerate its strength over Vrbo. Direct bookings are gaining guest mindshare, but the consistency of technology and experience is still not up to consumer expectations, so we won’t see a huge shift in direct booking share over the next year. ‍ Maria Flores Portillo, Managing Director, EMEA ‍ 2024 should hopefully be the new benchmark year for some of the markets that experienced a contraction of demand vs supply in the last 12-18 months, such as in the U.S. or the UK. Global macro factors seem to be slightly more stable, which will be a very necessary factor to move into a new normal.  ‍ Europe, however, will likely experience a harder year as some of the demand contraction that we have seen in the U.S. overflows. We are already observing flatter demand vs previous years, and most Southern Europe property managers are getting ready for much tougher competition.  ‍ Regulations will continue to throw challenges especially (but not exclusively) in urban markets, with upcoming regional and national elections creating supply uncertainty and owners considering a move to mid or long-term rentals. We have however started to see the different industry actors forming a more united front to combat the hotel lobbyists and I am optimistic about some of the dialogue that is currently happening at a local and regional level. Whilst regulation is unavoidable, it is possible to create a sustainable framework that legitimizes the short-term rental industry as the beneficial economic sector for society that it has become. ‍ We will also continue to see the rise of property managers adopting an entire-building approach to de-risk regulatory constraints and diversifying into new models such as co-Living and corporate rentals, which is highly untapped.  ‍ As ever, technology, data, and revenue management craftsmanship will dictate who thrives and who doesn’t in this complex landscape. Relying on historical data makes less sense than ever - we have moved to a world where revenue managers need to be able to predict demand with the right set of tools, rather than react to it. The complexity has already created a surge of consulting firms that aim to advise property managers on revenue management, and I predict that this trend will continue into 2024.  ‍ Brian Brendell, Senior Vice President Product ‍ Coming off a year that saw many markets retreat from pandemic-fueled highs, I believe we will see a period of relative stability. The supply and demand inequity we saw this year will shift back to a period of regular growth. And in an ‘average’ time, having access to real-time, reliable data will be more important than ever.  ‍ Property managers will be fighting to acquire, or re-acquire owners lost during the down year to drive the next stage of growth. Those property managers with access to reliable, proven performance data to share with those owners will be the most successful. This will cause property managers who have been resisting adopting technologies and pricing their properties by spreadsheet to lose out.  ‍ Artificial Intelligence and machine learning will continue their march across the STR industry, with everyone saying they ‘do AI.’ At the same time, property managers and hosts are becoming more sophisticated than ever. So, the few solutions that actually leverage these technologies to understand their users' strategies and use that personalization to drive revenue growth will win out. ‍ Caitlin Cassady, Vice President, Marketing ‍ With the supply of vacation rentals growing worldwide, standing out from the crowd and meeting guests where they are will be critical for driving more revenue in 2024. This means data-driven revenue management strategies like pricing &amp; distribution are table stakes, and using that data to attract and incentivize more guests will be where we see the winners take the lead.  ‍ What does attracting those guests look like? The most successful vacation rental businesses will focus on using data to improve the experience side – highlighting the amenities they know guests are searching for in their area, creating flexible marketing strategies that allow them to react quickly to promote new events in their area, and highlighting their 5-star reviews to increase booking conversion. Combining the marketing strategies that attract guests with data-driven strategies that increase bookings will be the recipe for success in 2024.  ‍ Jeffrey Breece, Director, Revenue Management ‍ I’m predicting that 2024 will be the new baseline year, finally replacing 2019. It’s got all the markings of a new normal, as we see the tailwinds of multi-year pent-up demand travel has fully dissipated, and new travel trends take hold. A good baseline year is defined when there is a relative balance between supply and demand - stability, which we are moving towards. Steady revenues will mostly be welcomed but there will be a squeeze felt by most as costs continue to outpace. The industry overall will continue to grow and new bright spots will emerge, but 2024 will be incredibly average to those average hosts and property managers out there.  ‍ Ryan Saylor, Director, Product Marketing ‍ I agree that (hopefully) 2024 is more of a stable year for the short-term rental market. 2023 was really the first year that most markets started to struggle compared to previous years and revenue managers had to adapt quickly – which acted as a forcing function for property managers to harness their revenue management skills and ensure they had everything at their disposal to counteract changing market conditions. Supply growth has also been naturally slowing and I think market dynamics will settle a bit to allow rentals to get their footing ba\n",

      "Text: Winter '22-23 performance data shows that despite a volatile market, short-term rentals remain a strong investment  \n",
      ", /PRNewswire/ --  Evolve , the fastest-growing vacation rental hospitality company in North America with more than 25,000 properties in 750 markets, just unveiled its  seasonal analysis of important trends in the vacation rental industry  from winter 2022-23. With the market landscape constantly changing, Evolve's insights and metrics provide useful tips for short-term rental owners looking to maximize their home's performance.\n",
      "\"No market looks the same as last year — and with unpredictable patterns, it's more important than ever to stand out from the crowd,\" said Eric Schueller, Executive Vice President of Revenue at Evolve. \"As we look forward towards spring and summer, which are peak travel seasons for many regions across the U.S., now is the time for owners to proactively adapt to industry trends and keep their home competitive to help earn as much revenue as possible.\"\n",
      " Key takeaways and recommendations from Evolve's Vacation Rental Industry Trends Report: \n",
      " Market supply and demand are both growing, but supply continues to outpace demand. \n",
      "Demand for vacation rentals is at an all-time high (up 9% from 2022, and 70% from 2019) — meaning more guests are booking than ever before. In fact, when Evolve asked travelers about their 2023 plans, 82% said they want to stay in a vacation home. However, supply is up 22% year over year (YoY), and this growth is causing total revenue per property to be down YoY.\n",
      "With more rentals vying for bookings, it simply makes things more competitive — and it requires owners to get more aggressive with their optimization strategies if they want to convince guests to choose their home over the many options available.\n",
      " Even with the market shifting, vacation rental investments continue to be a smart move for owners. \n",
      "Years like 2020 and 2021 were such anomalies that businesses often evaluate vacation rental industry trends and statistics against pre-pandemic times to avoid a skewed look at performance.\n",
      "When compared to 2019, total revenue growth still remains strong at the per-property level. Total revenue per property for Evolve homes is up 28% vs 2019.\n",
      "It's also following expected growth rates that likely would have been present had the pandemic — and subsequent rebound from — not caused the extremes that it did. This shows that a vacation rental investment has been a smart move for owners.\n",
      " It's essential to align with how the market is performing today. \n",
      "Unpredictable factors at play — like sky-high inflation, more interest rate hikes, expensive airfare, and abnormal weather patterns from coast-to-coast — are shifting both booking behavior and the destinations people are interested in visiting.\n",
      "Booking windows continue to show guests are planning ahead, so owners should lower average daily rates (ADRs) earlier in order to encourage upfront bookings (60+ days out from travel).\n",
      " One-size fits all is the wrong approach. \n",
      "Offering  highly-sought-after amenities  can be the difference between your home being chosen over someone else's in such a competitive market.\n",
      "From tricking out your outdoor living space with features like a hot tub, fire pit, or fully furnished deck to adding indoor must-haves like high-speed internet, AC, and in-home laundry, it's worth investing in items guests are looking for when booking trips.\n",
      "While ADRs are a strategic lever you should pull regularly, there are others available — including flexible cancellation policies, providing five-star guest support (and soliciting guest reviews), and strategically designing property listing content to show up in guest searches so they know your home is a solid option.\n",
